# NumberPrettifier
A python script that prettifies numbers

## Description
This repo features two files prettifier.py and test_prettifier.py. 

prettifier.py contains the main logic for the code and prettifies numbers in the range from a million to trillions. If the value is less than a million the code will just print the raw number out as a string i.e. 1000, if the value is negative it will return an error. If the value is quadrillion or greater it will also return an error. 

test_prettifier.py contains 10 unit tests that test various inputs into number_prettifier() which is the main function of prettifier.py
